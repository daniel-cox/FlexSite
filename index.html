      <h4>Dimebag</h4>
      <h1>Pantera</h1>
      <p> Dimebag Darrell, born Darrell Lance Abbott on August 20, 1966, left an indelible mark on the world of heavy metal music. He rose to prominence as the electrifying guitarist of the legendary bands Pantera and Damageplan, co-founding both alongside his brother Vinnie Paul. Dimebag's unparalleled guitar skills and distinctive style played a pivotal role in shaping the groove metal genre, with albums like "Cowboys from Hell" and "Vulgar Display of Power" becoming iconic in the metal world. Tragically, his life was cut short when he was shot and killed on stage in 2004, but his enduring legacy as one of the greatest metal guitarists of all time lives on, celebrated by fans and fellow musicians alike for his unmatched talent, charisma, and passion for the music he loved.</p>

      <h1>Periphery</h1>
      <p>Misha Mansoor (born October 31, 1984), also known as Bulb after the name of his solo project, is an American musician, best known as the founder of and one of the three guitarists in the progressive metal band Periphery.[1][2] He is also a part of the projects Haunted Shores and Four Seconds Ago, and Of Man, Not of Machine.

        Mansoor is considered to be one of the forerunners of the djent movement and is often erroneously attributed with the invention of the word itself (whose invention he attributes to Meshuggah guitarist Fredrik Thordendal).[3] With Periphery, Mansoor has recorded, produced, and released seven studio albums: a self-titled debut, Periphery II: This Time It's Personal, Juggernaut: Alpha, Juggernaut: Omega, Periphery III: Select Difficulty, Periphery IV: Hail Stan, and Periphery V: Djent Is Not a Genre. Mansoor has been named one of the Top 20 best guitarists of the 2010s by Guitar World magazine.</p>
